# Overload for AS3

Tired of reading blogs where people complain about what AS3 is lacking and being inspired by the old [as2lib][] overload functionality I have decided to make my own for AS3 as a proof of concept.

## TODOs and To Address ##
* Add Unit testing
* Test Booleans
* Can we test against different Number types(i.e. uint, int, Number)
** What problems does that bring up
